# Colophon

This is an example of a colophon page. It's designed to be a simple static page, similar to an article, but without an author, timestamp, and missing from the index. The intended use is to describe yourself, the site, and any software, fonts, design elements, etc. that visitors might want to know about. It's also a good place to mention any copyright notices or license notices that are required by other content, or that you wish to place on your own content. Some inspiration: [Daring Fireball][], [Ethan Schoonover][], [Jeffery Zeldman][].

Like all other elements, it's generated from a Markdown file. All of the same treatment that articles get is applied to it (i.e. typogrify, image captions, code highlighting).
